           <p>
            Roblox is an online platform and storefront where users go to play games. Roblox is not a game, it is a place where people play games made by other developers. In this sense, it is more similar to PC platform Steam than it is to any online childrens game. <br>

            What makes Roblox different from anything else in the games industry — including a storefront like Steam — is that all the games are made by its users. On Roblox, the fun doesnt just come from playing games, it also comes from making games. These games are not formally developed by Roblox Corporation, but by users of the platform. Currently, the official website boasts that its users have published over 20 million games on the platform.

                In case you weren't sure, "World of Warcraft" is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, or MMORPG for short. That means it takes place in a huge, persistent world where players run around and do quests with each other, level up, collect loot and maybe even fight each other.
